# Computer Graphics Labs

These are the template files for the Computer Graphics module taught at the Manchester Metopolitan University.

## Get the files

Install git if you haven't already done so ([instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)) and clone the repository using the command prompt/terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/jonshiach/computer-graphics-labs.git
```

Or download the [zip file](https://github.com/jonshiach/Lab09_Normal_maps/zipball/master/), extract the files and rename the root folder `Lab09_Normal_maps/`.

## Build instructions

2. In the **computer-graphics-labs** folder create a folder and call it **build/**.
3. Click on **Browse Source...** next to 'Where is the source code?' and select the **computer-graphics-labs/** folder.
4. Do the same for 'Where to build the binaries?' and select the **computer-graphics-labs/build/** folder.
5. Click **Configure** and select Visual Studio (Windows) or Xcode (macOS) and click **Done**. Once the configuration is complete click **Configure** again.
6. Click **Generate**.

This will create a Visual Studio or Xcode project file in the **computer-graphics-labs/build/** folder. Double click on it to open the project and edit the source code.
